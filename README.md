How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    This project has helped me get a introduction to OpenGL and how it operates.
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
    I worked in small chunks and as things started working I increased the number objects and/or streamlined code.
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    This is how I operate today. Basically get things working and then go back and clean up the code.
How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    Nothing really new just needed to learn to be patient with and and think about how each section of the code is going to run and where.
  How did iteration factor into your development?
    There were many iterations at first until I developed the framework that I wanted to work in.
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    Biggest thing was to take more of a thoughtful process and think about how each line of code will operate.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    It gave me more exposure to c++ plus it gave me another tool in my bag of skills to sharpen.
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    It really gives me a perspective on how some of the graphical frameworks work and to give them more respect as to how hard they are to do.
